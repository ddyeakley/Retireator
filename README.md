# Retireator
Retireator is a free retirement simulator, written in Microsoft Excel, with a focus on short and medium term financial planning.  Retireator was created by Larry Blumer, Jr.  The Microsoft Excel platform allows for the tool to be open and infinitely adaptable by both developers and non-developers alike.

# Quick start
1) Microsoft Excel 2010 is required (presently developed using 14.0.7145.5000 32-bit)

2) Clone the repo: git clone https://github.com/llblumer/Retireator

3) The 7zip command line tools should be installed and added to path (optional)

4) VS Express 2013 for Desktop (optional)

5) Start Developer Command Prompt for VS2013 (or equivalent with nmake capability)

6) Run nmake in the Excel_2010 directory to compress the xlsx_dbg folder down to the xlsx file

The xlsx file format is really just a zip, so the contents of the xlsx_dbg folder can be manually added to a zip and renamed to xlsx if desired.  The xlsx should be extracted back to the xlsx_dbg folder to commit changes back to the repo.
